            <p>Universally acknowledged as the “Paradise on the Earth”, the land of Kashmir is a perfect home to nature’s creation. Right from the costliest spice on earth, “Saffron” to the very famous, sweet and aromatic “Kashmiri Apple”, mother nature has bestowed the region with numerous natural gifts. Since the area is diverse in its flora and fauna, it gives a natural habitat to bees to collect nectar (the acacia flower being the primary source) and produce organic honey</p>

            <p>One of the ideal meals and medicines that can provide you with a variety of health-improving and -supporting advantages is Kashmiri White Honey. By mid-May, the beekeepers gather the two species of bees, Apis Cerana Indica (native bees) and Apis Mellifera, to begin the harvesting procedure (domesticated bees). Since ancient times, honey has been utilised both internally and externally as an ayurvedic medication. Natural sweetener organic honey has a low glycemic index. If you're seeking for a substitute for sugar, Organic Kashmiri White Honey will provide the desired flavour.</p>
