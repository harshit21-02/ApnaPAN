        There is no field- political, social or economic in which the women of Jammu and Kashmir haven’t earned accolades and prestige. Infact, the social status of women in the society of Jammu and Kashmir is very much better than other parts of the country

        Female entrepreneurship is vital for our future. Collectively we can make a change by closing the gap between men and women in the workforce.
Entrepreneurs are those adventurous, daredevils who drive deep into the pressing problems of society and try to find solutions to them, not by leaving the responsibilities in the reins of the government or business, but by trying to change systems as a whole and persuading societies to take new initiatives

    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        These bold and fearlessly ambitious entrepreneurs are shaping the future of Jammu and Kashmir serving as mentors to millions of women and youths
