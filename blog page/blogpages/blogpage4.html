            <p>Every day when Masrat Jan finishes her household chores, she enters her workshop, sits on a custom-made low stool, and picks up her brushes. In her 50s, Jan, a well-known papier-mache artist living in the congested Lal Bazar neighbourhood of Srinagar, Kashmir, says that the artifact she is working on will be completed in a week.
                In the mundane environs, the colorful place has given her life meaning as she sits surrounded by polished artifacts of all hues, enamel bottles, and brushes.
                Jan dips her brush in a watercolor and starts creating circular designs on a white ball made of paper pulp

            <p>“This art gives me solace. It was brought to us by our elders and Sufi saints. More than earning, I do it out of reverence,” she says as she sat cross-legged inside her workshop hosting multiple papier mache products such as flower vases and pencil holders.</p>

            Papier mache involves making of different shapes like vases, trays, boxes and animal shapes by applying paper pulp over moulds, then drying those objects, polishing them, and finally painting them intricately with multiple hues.
The craft like many other handicrafts like shawl weaving, embroidery is believed to have entered Kashmir with the advent of Islam in the 14-15th century as historians say papier mache was introduced from Persia during the reign of Kashmiri King, Sultan Zainul Abidin
